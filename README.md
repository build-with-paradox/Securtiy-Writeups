**Note:** 

- Not all of the **50+ challenges** I‚Äôve solved on TryHackMe and HackTheBox are currently documented in this repository or on Medium. More write-ups will be added over time.

- This repository includes write-ups for **TryHackMe** rooms only. Due to HTB‚Äôs policy against documenting active rooms, I have not included any active Hack The Box (HTB) room write-ups here.

- However, I have solved various **HTB** challenges, and I encourage you to check my progress on my HTB profile.
